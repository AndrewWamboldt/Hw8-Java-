Madison is the capital of Wisconsin, but it wasn't always.
Belmont was the original.
The capitol was established in 1836, when Wisconsin was not yet a state but a territory.
You can still visit the Council House and a lodging house for then legislators at this historic site just west of Belmont Mound State Park.
